# Features

Solar is shaped by a set of deliberate features designed to stay out of your way while improving how the web feels. Rather than chasing novelty each feature exists to support speed privacy control and clarity. This section outlines the core capabilities that define Solar and explains how thoughtful engineering turns simplicity into a better browsing experience.

## Speed


### Fast by design not by hype

Solar is built with performance as a structural decision rather than an afterthought. Clean architecture predictable execution paths and minimal overhead allow pages to load quickly animations to remain smooth and interactions to feel immediate without relying on aggressive shortcuts or legacy optimizations.

## Privacy


### Control without constant attention

Privacy in Solar is quiet and intentional. Protection is enabled by default reducing tracking surfaces limiting background communication and keeping your browsing activity contained without requiring repeated choices or intrusive prompts.


## Universal Extensions


### Freedom without lock in

Solar supports modern extension standards without forcing users into a closed ecosystem. Extensions remain isolated predictable and compatible allowing your existing tools to work seamlessly while preserving performance and security.


## Sync


### Your data everywhere on your terms

Synchronization in Solar is optional encrypted and restrained. Only the data you choose is synced across devices ensuring continuity without sacrificing ownership or privacy.


## Customization


### Behavior over decoration

Customization goes beyond visual themes. Solar allows you to shape behavior interaction flow and background activity creating a browser that adapts to how you work rather than how it wants to be used.


## Built in Intelligence


### Assistance without intrusion

Solar integrates intelligent features designed to assist without interruption. AI tools remain optional context aware and discreet supporting tasks such as summarization translation and content generation without taking control.


## Efficiency


### Light by nature

Solar is engineered to stay responsive even under sustained load. Resource usage is deliberate visible and restrained allowing the browser to remain smooth efficient and battery friendly across a wide range of devices.


## Advanced Controls


### Precision when you need it

Solar offers depth without forcing complexity. Advanced controls and developer focused tools are available when needed while remaining invisible during everyday browsing.
