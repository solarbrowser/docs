# Overview - For Developers

Welcome. This space is for those who want to look closer. Solar is built to be understandable inspectable and open to questioning. Here you will find documentation that explains how things work why certain decisions were made and how you can build experiment or contribute without guessing what happens behind the scenes. No magic no black boxes just clear systems.
