# Extension development

Solar is designed with universal extension support in mind, ensuring freedom and compatibility without lock-in. We are building a platform where your tools work seamlessly while preserving performance and security.

## Extension Standards Support

Solar aims to support multiple extension standards, providing maximum compatibility and flexibility for developers:

### Manifest V2 & V3

Solar plans to support both Manifest V2 and Manifest V3 extension formats, allowing developers to use existing extensions and migrate at their own pace. This dual support ensures backward compatibility while embracing modern extension capabilities.

### Solar Native API

In addition to standard web extension APIs, Solar will provide its own native extension API, designed to leverage Solar's unique architecture and features. This API will offer:

- Direct access to Solar-specific features
- Enhanced performance optimizations
- Deeper browser integration
- Advanced customization capabilities

## Early Access & Testing

If you have an existing extension or are interested in building one for Solar, we welcome early collaboration:

- **Join the testing program**: Once extension development begins, you can participate in the early testing phase
- **Get feedback and support**: Work directly with our team to ensure your extension works seamlessly
- **Free publishing**: Everyone will be able to publish their extensions for free on the upcoming Solar Extensions Store
