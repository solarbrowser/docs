## Performance

Solar is designed from the ground up for the modern web. Unlike legacy engines burdened by accumulated technical debt and outdated architectures, Solar embraces simplicity, efficiency, and speed.

### Modern web architecture

Built to leverage contemporary CPU/GPU designs and web patterns, Solar’s architecture minimizes unnecessary layers and streamlines execution.

### Lightweight rendering pipeline

Every frame, style, and layout is processed with a minimalistic pipeline that reduces overhead and enhances rendering speed.

### Advantages of a ground-up engine

Solar isn’t a patched legacy engine. Its foundation allows for faster execution, cleaner data flow, and elimination of obsolete layers that slow other browsers down.

### Memory efficiency

Optimized memory usage ensures that even complex web applications consume less RAM, keeping devices responsive under load.

### Performance on low-end hardware

Solar maintains speed and smoothness across a wide range of devices, from high-end desktops to constrained mobile platforms.

## Security

Security is a first-class citizen in Solar. Designed with modern principles, it avoids the pitfalls of inherited legacy models that often require complex workarounds to protect against contemporary threats.

### Isolation-based architecture

Each tab runs in its own sandbox, with strictly limited interaction, reducing the attack surface and containing potential compromises.

### Principle of minimum privilege

Processes and components only access what is strictly necessary, preventing unnecessary escalation and exposure.

### Data privacy

User data is never exposed beyond its intended scope, and default configurations favor privacy without requiring manual tweaking.

### Secure extension model

Extensions operate under strict boundaries and permissions, minimizing the risk of malicious code affecting the core browser or other extensions.

### Network security fundamentals

Built-in protections and modern encryption standards safeguard communication, ensuring web traffic remains confidential and tamper-resistant.
